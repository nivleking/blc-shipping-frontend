# BLC Shipping Simulation

A comprehensive web-based simulation system for maritime container logistics management.

## Overview

BLC Shipping is an interactive educational platform designed to simulate container logistics operations in shipping. The application transforms a previously manual simulation into a digital experience, enabling participants to learn about stowage planning, revenue optimization, and logistics decision-making in a realistic yet engaging environment.

## Documentation

Before trying the application, we recommend reviewing the comprehensive manual book that covers all features and functionality:

The manual book includes:
- Detailed explanations of the simulation concept
- Step-by-step guides for both admin and participant roles
- Instructions for setting up and managing simulation rooms
- Tutorial for container stowage planning
- Guide to understanding weekly performance metrics
- Troubleshooting common issues

**Note**: We strongly recommend reading through the manual book before attempting to deploy or use the application for the first time.
